				Welcome to the project page of the Solid Elections project. Here you can find everything you need to get
				started with our product. We have made a proof-of-concept that would replace the current bureaucratic 
				process needed to declare campaign expences made by political lists and candidates. This has been commissioned
				by the ABB, Algmeen Binnenlands Bestuur. Their assignment was for us to simplify and digitalize the declaration
				process using technologies like Solid and Linked data. You can find out more about our goals and solutions.

						<h3>The Solid ecosystem</h3>
						During this project we have opted to use the Solid ecosystem. This is a newfangled way of storing data
						in a decentralized manner. In short, each user has their own 'Solid Pod', on which they store various
						data files. When a service, such as ours wants data from your pod, the user has to approve this transfer.
						We thereby improve safety and give back ownership of data to the user. Click
