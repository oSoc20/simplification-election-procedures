				Welcome to the project page of the Solid Elections project. Here you can find everything you need to get
				started with our product. We have made a proof-of-concept that would replace the current bureaucratic
				process needed to declare campaign expences made by political lists and candidates. This has been commissioned
				by the ABB, Algmeen Binnenlands Bestuur. Their assignment was for us to simplify and digitalize the declaration
				process using technologies like Solid and Linked data.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="full-length-paragraph">
				To scale down this project within our scope, we decided to split the team and the project in three.
				The submission team will deal with the actual forms that polititians will fill in. The frontend team will be
				responsible for clearly displaying all data. Lastly the API team will act as a bridge between the two.

							<h3>The Solid ecosystem</h3>
							<p>
								During this project we have opted to use the Solid ecosystem. This is a newfangled way of storing data
								in a decentralized manner. In short, each user has their own 'Solid Pod', on which they store various
								data files. When a service, such as ours wants data from your pod, the user has to approve this transfer.
								We thereby improve safety and give back ownership of data to the user. Click

							<h3>True transparency</h3>
							<p>
								Lastly, we wanted this project to ensure full transparency for both citizens and polititions. First of all,
								this means the entire source code is available
								<a href="https://github.com/osoc20" target="_blank">here</a>. Secondly, we have built an intuitive interface
								that can acces, query, sort and graphically display all data, giving civilians, researchers and other
								interested parties important insights.

							<h3>Simplify everything</h3>
							<p>
								Another one of our goals was to greatly simplify the declaration process for political lists and candidates.
								To accomplish this, we have made several improvements to the current forms. For example, we have isolated
								any personal data, so users will only have to fill those fields once. We have also implemented several checks
								ensuring proper data submission.

					This project has been realized by an amazing team of students, brought together by the Open Summer of Code. We are experts
					in several fields like Communication, Design in both User experience and Visuals, Backend, System administration and Frontend
					design. In special, we want to thank ABB for providing us the oppertunity to develop this application. We also like to thank
					Rutger Bevers, Jodi De Loof and Open Summer of Code for providing the support we needed to complete this project.
